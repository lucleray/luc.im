# Take-away project for a "front-end" job interview

### Sept 2017

During my work at Supahands, I wrote a simple take-home project
intended to assess candidates for the _Front-end Developer_ job
position.

I wanted to assess 3 main things :

<Card>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Skills : is the candidate able to write clear code to solve a simple
      problem ?
    </li>
    <li>
      Motivation : is the candidate ready to spend around 1 hour of work for us
      ?
    </li>
    <li>Autonomy : does the candidate ask relevant questions ?</li>
  </ol>
</Card>

I sent them an email :

<Card>
  <p>Hi,</p>
  <p>I would like to challenge ffdsffdsgd you with a dfdsfds small take-home project.</p>
  <p>
    Build a simple web page displaying the data of this json file :{' '}
    <A newtab href="/static/articles/restaurants.json">
      restaurants.json
    </A>
  </p>
  <p>Display the content of the file in a table</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Add buttons to filter the list by type of cuisine</li>
    <li>Display the number of the restaurants displayed</li>
    <li>You can start with this jsfiddle.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    <A newtab href="https://jsfiddle.net/Lvu938b4/">
      You can start with this jsfiddle.
    </A>
  </p>
  <p>Don't spend too much time, just do as much as you can :)</p>
  <p>If you have any questions, let me know.</p>
  <p>Good luck !</p>
</Card>

I made a jsfiddle because I wanted candidates to spend as little time
as possible on the task. At the end of the day, the aim is only to
know if the candidate has a **basic level of javascript**.

The jsfiddle already contains the structure of the html, because I
believe anyone who can use jquery properly knows html.
