    <p>
      During my work at Supahands, I wrote a simple take-home project intended
      to assess candidates for the <em>Front-end Developer</em> job position.
    </p>

    <p>I wanted to assess 3 main things :</p>

    <Card>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Skills : is the candidate able to write clear code to solve a simple
          problem ?
        </li>
        <li>
          Motivation : is the candidate ready to spend around 1 hour of work for
          us ?
        </li>
        <li>Autonomy : does the candidate ask relevant questions ?</li>
      </ol>
    </Card>

    <p>I sent them an email :</p>

    <Card>
      <p>Hi,</p>
      <p>I would like to challenge you with a small take-home project.</p>
      <p>
        Build a simple web page displaying the data of this json file :{' '}
        <A newtab href="/static/articles/restaurants.json">
          restaurants.json
        </A>
      </p>
      <p>Display the content of the file in a table</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Add buttons to filter the list by type of cuisine</li>
        <li>Display the number of the restaurants displayed</li>
        <li>You can start with this jsfiddle.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <A newtab href="https://jsfiddle.net/Lvu938b4/">
          You can start with this jsfiddle.
        </A>
      </p>
      <p>Don't spend too much time, just do as much as you can :)</p>
      <p>If you have any questions, let me know.</p>
      <p>Good luck !</p>
    </Card>

    <p>
      I made a jsfiddle because I wanted candidates to spend as little time as
      possible on the task. At the end of the day, the aim is only to know if
      the candidate has a <b>basic level of javascript</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The jsfiddle already contains the structure of the html, because I believe
      anyone who can use jquery properly knows html.
    </p>
